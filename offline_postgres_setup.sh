# =========================================================
# Note: Here we would normally include base64-encoded binaries
# for PostgreSQL. However, this would make the script very large.
#
# For a real implementation, we would include:
# - initdb (binary)
# - postgres (binary)
# - pg_ctl (binary)
# - psql (binary)
# - createdb (binary)
# and other essential binaries
# =========================================================

# The script would continue with setting up the database after extracting binaries
# Similar to the other scripts we've created:
# - Initialize database with initdb
# - Configure PostgreSQL
# - Start the server
# - Create user and database
# - Set up environment variables
